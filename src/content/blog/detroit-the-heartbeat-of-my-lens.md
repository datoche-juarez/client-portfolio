From the Parisian boulevards to the ancient wonders of Egypt, my lens has danced with diverse landscapes, but it is the heartbeat of Detroit that reverberates in every frame. The familiarity of my hometown has granted me an intimate view, a lens into the raw authenticity of human experience. Detroit, with its industrial echoes and vibrant communities, is my anchor. It has shaped me as an artist, influencing my visual language and infusing my work with a unique narrative. While the world has offered inspiration, Detroit's streets have provided an unparalleled canvasâ€”a canvas woven with the threads of resilience, struggle, and triumph. In the juxtaposition of these experiences, I've discovered the value of capturing authenticity, reminding me that the truest stories emerge from the familiar embrace of home.
