Growing up in the heartbeat of Motown, my journey into the world of photography was a serendipitous dance with time. The streets of Detroit served as my canvas, each alleyway and cityscape telling stories that echoed the resilience and creativity of its people. It all began with my grandmother's old film cameraâ€”a relic from a bygone era. As I navigated the nuances of life, that camera became my time machine, freezing moments and emotions in frames. Detroit's eclectic mix of cultures and its ever-changing landscapes became my muse, shaping my perspective and igniting a passion for visual storytelling. Little did I know that those early captures would be the foundation of a lifelong love affair with photography.
