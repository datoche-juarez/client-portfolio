Photography, to me, is a danceâ€”a choreography of light, shadow, and emotion. The choice of camera, whether digital or film, becomes a partner in this dance, influencing the rhythm and nuances of the visual narrative. While the debate between digital and film photography persists, I've come to see these tools as means to an end, each with its unique charm. Digital's immediacy captures the spontaneity of life, while film introduces an element of anticipation, a tangible connection to the past. Ultimately, the camera is a conduit for storytelling, a vessel for translating moments into visual poetry. The dance is not about the tools but about the stories we unveil, transcending the medium and resonating with the hearts of those who witness the performance.
